# Video cli program

`video` is a ffmpeg wrapper.

## !! Important !!

This is by no means intended to be an elegant Go program. It was developed for
personal convenience to pragmatically learn, document and somewhat structure
complex ffmpeg features replacing previous solutions that involved even more
complex and ugly batch and bash scripts.

There may be future attempts to structure this more elegantly.
